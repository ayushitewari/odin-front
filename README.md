# Introduction 
“In a knowledge-rich world, progress does not lie in the direction of reading and writing information faster or storing more of it. Progress lies in the direction of extracting and exploiting the patterns of the world so that far less information needs to be read, written, or stored.” (Herbert Simon, 1971)

While the availability of big data and the advancement of methods to analyze them allow researchers to test hypotheses and validate theories, it is not clear how it can facilitate exploration and inductive understanding of social phenomena especially when data is unstructured, making it less amenable to quantification and computation.

Making complex inter-related information, not just available, but truly accessible, is critical for an informed society. The Open Data Innovation Project (ODIN) project seeks to make textual data repositories useable rather than simply available by processing and visualizing text data for human sensemaking. We encourage you to watch the tutorial video, explore the guided walkthoughs and experience the platform yourself!

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
